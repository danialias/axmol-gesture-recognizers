Axmol Engine Gesture Recognizers
=============================

Adaptation for Axmol Engine (WIP)

Original version by [Alfonso Grillo](https://github.com/alfogrillo)

This project is an extension of Cocos2d-x that provide touch Gesture Recognizers.

The classes recognize the following gestures:

- **Swipe** (one finger, 4 directions)
- **Long press** (one or multiple fingers)
- **Pinch** with rotation (two fingers)
- **Pan** (one or multiple fingers)
- **Tap** (one or multiple taps with one or multiple fingers)

My work was inspired by Apple documentation about the Gesture Recognizers:

[Apple Gesture Recognizers](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/EventHandling/Conceptual/EventHandlingiPhoneOS/GestureRecognizer_basics/GestureRecognizer_basics.html) for iOS

The code was tested on
- Android 5.1.1 physical device
- iOS 10.1 physical devices (iPhone and iPad)

Latest version tested with: **Cocos2d-x 3.13** :+1:

How to build the sample project
----------

**iOS**

- Create a new cocos2d-x project:
```
	cocos new -l cpp TEST
```
- Copy the `cocos2d` folder from `TEST` to the repository root folder
- Open the Xcode project inside the `proj.ios_mac` folder
- Build

**Android**

- Create a new cocos2d-x project:
```
	cocos new -l cpp TEST
```
- Copy the `cocos2d` folder from `TEST` to the repository root folder
- With terminal go inside the repository root folder
- Run:
```
	cocos run -s . -p android --android-studio
```


How to integrate gestures code inside your (or new) project
----------

The repository contains two folders inside `Classes` folder:
- Gestures
- Test

The actual gesture recognition require **only** the `Gestures` folder.
The `Test` folder contains various example scenes.
To try the code you can do the following steps:

**iOS**

- Create a new cocos2d-x project:
```
	cocos new -l cpp <project name>
```
- Delete `Classes` e `Resources` folders from the sample project and add those of this repository
- Update your Xcode project with Classes and Resources folders
- Enable multi touch in file `ios/AppController.mm`. The line you must modify should look like this:
```
	[eaglView setMultipleTouchEnabled:YES]
```

   For further informations see how to enable multi-touch [here](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/wiki/How_to_Enable_Multi-Touch)


**Android**

- Create a new cocos2d-x project:
```
	cocos new -l cpp <project name>
```
- Delete `Classes` and `Resources` folders from the sample project and add those of this repository
- Add the source file of this repo in `proj.andorid/jni/Android.mk`
